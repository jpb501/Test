on the 17th March 2015 at 12 noon UK time. Could I ask the following two questions:

Is the vanilla version of 5.4sp5 the best version of the software to upgrade too?

Could I schedule in to have some support at 1pm on the 17th March if we have any issues. My mobile is 07990783839.

Thanks Jeffrey Barber

We have had issues in the recent past with updates.
